## Overview üöÄ

CMCS is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of submitting and approving monthly claims for contract lecturers. The system replaces a manual, paper-based workflow with a digital solution, improving efficiency and providing a clear audit trail.

This project was developed using **ASP.NET Core MVC** with **Entity Framework Core** and **ASP.NET Identity** for user management and role-based authorization.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Role-Based Dashboards:** Users see a dashboard tailored to their role (Lecturer, Programme Coordinator, or Academic Manager).
* **Secure Authentication:** Secure user authentication and management are handled by ASP.NET Identity.
* **Claim Submission:** Lecturers can digitally submit their monthly claims, including hours worked, and attach multiple supporting documents (e.g., payslips, contracts).
* **Document Management:** The system supports uploading and storing supporting documents related to claims.
* **Multi-Stage Approval Workflow:** Claims follow a defined workflow:
    1.  **Lecturer** submits a claim.
    2.  **Programme Coordinator** reviews and approves the claim.
    3.  **Academic Manager** gives the final approval.
    4.  **Admin** manages user roles and account.
* **Database Management:** The application uses Entity Framework Core to manage the database schema and data, with a clear separation of models for Claims, Documents, Lecturers, and the different user roles.

## How to use the CMCS System
1. **Register:** Firstly, the user needs to have an account to use the system, thus required to create an account.
2. **Login:** After creating an account, and confirming it, the user then logs into the system.
3. **Note:** The user must choose the role (e.g. Lecturer, Programme Coordinator, and Academic Manager) when creating the account to see the appropriate dashboard. The Lecturer will see a Claim button to submit a claim and send supporting documents. The Programme Coordinator and Academic Manager will see their own dashboard to either Accept/Reject a claim if it has been made by the Lecturer, and write a note to the Lecturer if the claim is rejected.
